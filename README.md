# HARDEST TODO LIST EVER
The project plans to create the most complex todo list ever conceived.
In the world of tutorials and programming, the "todo list" is the basic exercise, used to introduce the basic concepts and therefore always made simple in its implementation.
The idea, therefore, is to subvert this mechanism, introducing various complexities related to design and functionality.
The project was created for my own Youtube channel [Carmhack](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCarmhack/about).
